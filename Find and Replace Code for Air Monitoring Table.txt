Instructions to reformat the Air Monitoring Table html file to work with the app, after exporting it from excel as a web page:
Open in Notepad++. 

Run the following find and replace (hit ctrl+f), in search mode= regular expression. Place check marks in "match case" and ". matches newline". 
In each set, line 1 is the find, line 2 is the replace. 

1. First, place <thead> and </thead> around the headers of the table, and <tbody and </tbody> around the body. The lines below will do this automatically. (changes to the first and last rows of the table might break this find and replace).
	FIND: 
	(<tr[^T]+Target.*?Sample.*?</tr>)(.*?Ludlum 2241.*?</tr>)
	Replace:
	<thead>\n\1\n</thead>\n<tbody>\2\n</tbody>

2. Within thead (between <thead> and </thead>, replace all td with th. 
	replace one at a time. 


3. Replace the following symbols.

degrees symbol
°
&deg;

cubed
³
&#179;

micro
µ
&micro;

umlaut a
ä
&#228;

4. the following find and replace expressions allow the left-most column to be "sticky" by replacing td with th. 
The width of the column is 104; if the column width changes, you will need to replace 104 with the new width. 

single line
<td([^x]+x[^w]+width=104[^/]+)</td>
<th\1</th>

with breaks within chemical name
<td([^x]+x[^w]+width=104[^/]+/[^/]+)</td>
<th\1</th>

removes spaces at the ends of lines
(<span[^<]+</span>)
replace with space.

Finally, replace all th with td in the footer/notes section. Do not run this code on the entire page of code;
rather, navigate to the footer section of the table (after </tbody>) and replace one at a time. 

<th([^x]+x[^w]+width=104[^/]+)</th>
<td\1</td>
